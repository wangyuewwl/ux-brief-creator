# UX Brief Assistant - Quick Start

Welcome! I'll help you create a comprehensive UX Brief for your stakeholders.

## What I'll do for you

1. ✅ **Learn from your docs** - I'll read your PRFAQ, BRD, design docs, etc.
2. ✅ **Fill the template** - I'll populate the UX Brief template with relevant info
3. ✅ **Identify gaps** - I'll highlight what needs your input
4. ✅ **Iterate with you** - We'll refine it together
5. ✅ **Export the brief** - I'll create a polished .docx file

## Let's get started!

### Step 1: Share your documentation

Please provide any existing documentation you have. This could be:
- **PRFAQ** (Product Requirements FAQ)
- **BRD** (Business Requirements Document)  
- **Design mockups or explorations**
- **User research findings**
- **Project plans or timelines**
- **Stakeholder information**
- **Any other relevant docs**

You can:
- Paste text directly
- Upload files
- Share links to internal docs
- Or just tell me about your project

### Step 2: Answer my questions

I'll ask clarifying questions about:
- Project goals and success criteria
- User personas and their needs
- Problem statements and pain points
- Your proposed solution
- Timeline and scope

### Step 3: Review and refine

I'll show you a draft and we'll iterate until you're happy with it.

### Step 4: Export

When ready, I'll create a .docx file you can share with stakeholders.
